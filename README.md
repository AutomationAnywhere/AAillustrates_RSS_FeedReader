# AAillustrates_RSS_FeedReader
Supporting files and bot for the RSS FeedReader AAillustrates session

The AAillustrates_RSS_FeedReader repository contains the source files used for creating the bot's webpage, as well as the bot itself which can be cloned, installed, modified, and executed in your own enviornment.

The purpose of this bot/supporting files is to demonstrate how to use some of the actions from the XML package as well as using the log to file action to create an html page. Similar logic could be used for created HTML emails, displaying graphs/charts of bot recorded data, or for creating cards which can reference other bots/content in your organization.
